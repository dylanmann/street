Why I hate RSS
===

* The feed takes ~8 seconds to load
* Only text of the article is given (no inner images or stuff like spotify playlists)
* Abstracts are missing (this can be fixed)
* No way to get articles other than the 50 most recent (need some way to cache articles - even then what about articles before we started caching)
